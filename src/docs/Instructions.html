<h2>Specific Chess Rules</h2>

<p>To select a piece, you first choose it's vertical location, 0-7. Then yo select it's horizontal direction, also 0-7.
    You then enter this 2 digit number to select the piece and you choose the piece's new location in the same way. The
    program will check to ensure that it is a valid movement and it will redirect you to rechoose if it isn't. Castling
    is done by selecting the Rook you wish to use. Again, the program will validate whether it is a legal move. 
</p>

<h2>General Chess Rules</h2>

<p>White is always first to move and players take turns alternately moving one piece at a time. Movement is required. If
    a player´s turn is to move, he is not in check but has no legal moves, this situation is called “Stalemate” and it
    ends the game in a draw. Each type of piece has its own method of movement. A piece may be moved to another position
    or may capture an opponent´s piece, replacing on its square (en passant being the only exception). With the
    exception of the knight, a piece may not move over or through any of the other pieces. When a king is threatened
    with capture (but can protect himself or escape), it´s called check. If a king is in check, then the player must
    make a move that eliminates the threat of capture and cannot leave the king in check. Checkmate happens when a king
    is placed in check and there is no legal move to escape. Checkmate ends the game and the side whose king was
    checkmated looses. Chess for kids would be a great option to help the kid enhance his thinking capability with the

<h2>Initial Set Up</h2>

<p>The chessboard is made up of eight rows and eight columns for a total of 64 squares of alternating colors. Each
    square of the chessboard is identified with a unique pair of numbers. The vertical and horizontal ranks are numbered
    from 0 to 7, starting from the top right side. Each square of the board, then, is uniquely identified by its file
    letter and rank number. The white and black pieces mirror each other</p>

<h2>Rules for each Piece's Movement</h2>
<p>These are 100% followed. Any invalid movement will be caught and not implemented</p>
<ul>
    <li>King can move exactly one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Once in every game, each king is allowed to make a special move, known as castling.</li>
    <li>Queen can move any number of vacant squares diagonally, horizontally, or vertically.</li>
    <li>Rook can move any number of vacant squares vertically or horizontally. It also is moved while castling.</li>
    <li>Bishop can move any number of vacant squares in any diagonal direction.</li>
    <li>Knight can move one square along any rank or file and then at an angle. The knight´s movement can also be viewed
        as an “L” or “7″ laid out at any horizontal or vertical angle.</li>
    <li>Pawns can move forward one square, if that square is unoccupied. If it has not yet moved, the pawn has the
        option of moving two squares forward provided both squares in front of the pawn are unoccupied. A pawn cannot
        move backward. Pawns are the only pieces that capture differently from how they move. They can capture an enemy
        piece on either of the two spaces adjacent to the space in front of them (i.e., the two squares diagonally in
        front of them) but cannot move to these spaces if they are vacant. The pawn is also involved in the two special
        moves en passant and promotion.</li>
</ul>
